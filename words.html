                	<h2 class="blog-post-title">A New Game</h2>
                	<h4 class="blog-post-meta">July 3, 2018</h4>
                	<p>Hi friends!</p>
                	<p>I am starting a new game!</p>
                	<p><b>What am I making?</b></p>
                	<p>I’m making a beat em up! With gnomes! There’s def more to it than that, but I’m going to stay a bit tight-lipped for now. But yay gnomes!</p>
                	<p>I am currently a team of one, but I have plans to hopefully expand a bit once I decide that the project is worth expanding. And once I have money to pay people, because paying people is important to me. Even if they’re my friends. Hell, especially if they’re my friends. I also intend to collaborate with other women, people of color, or just underrepresented groups in general. I want a team picture that truly embodies diversity, because I think that will lead to the strongest game.</p>
                	<p>Since I’m currently playing all the roles, this should be interesting! I started off by playing designer and writing up a couple of pages of design. Then, I put on my Mr. Manager face and made myself a fake Jira board in Google Spreadsheets.</p>
                	<p>Side note: I used to do a ton of data manipulation in excel during my undergrad (woo Environmental Engineering), but Google Spreadsheets is an entirely different beast. I was struggling hard to build a simple burndown chart, purely because I could not comprehend the graph UI. I could also just be super rusty. But doesn’t matter, figured it out. Saltiness abated.</p>
                	<p>Here’s some quick pics of what I made for myself!</p>
                	<img class="img-fluid" src="imgs/blog/tasks_week1.PNG" alt="Week 1 Tasks">
                	<img class="img-fluid" src="imgs/blog/burndown_week1.PNG" alt="Week 1 Tasks">
                	<p>If you’re judging me for my terrible burndown chart, keep in mind my hands hurt (I've been having p bad carpal tunnel symptoms) and I am quick to take long breaks when they act up. No game is worth my hands. I’m doing somewhat daily yoga (shout out to Yoga with Adriene on YouTube) and looking into a more ergonomic keyboard situation, so hopefully my charts will improve. Definitely better than the time one of my teams ended up with a burnup chart. Big oops.</p>
                	<p>Anyways, I started out with the game in 2D and quickly moved it into 3D. Movement made a lot more sense in a 3D space, since I need 3-axis movement and didn’t want to hack it into 2D if I didn’t need to.</p>
                	<p>It is currently very ugly to look at and the artist in me really hates that. But I have a somewhat solid start on my mood board, so I'm feeling good about that. Here’s a little pic of where I’m currently at:</p>
                	<img class="img-fluid" src="imgs/blog/game_week1.PNG" alt="Week 1 Tasks">
                	<p>So yeah. I’ll try to be better about sharing my progress! I definitely want to try and keep a weekly devlog happening. They will probably be more on topic, especially as I get more into the groove. I may play around the the blog format a bit here and there, since my website is made from scratch. Haven’t quite built something like that before, so should be fun.</p>
                	<p>Until then, feel free to hit me up on twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/imanfayek">@imanfayek</a>) if you want to chat about games or whatever!</p>
