                                    <p>Many fiber artists have what we refer to as a stash, or a collection of fiber for use in future projects. Each skein, or unit, of yarn has many important properties to keep track of that determine what projects it is most suitable for, what tools will work best, the drape of the finished object, etc. As one’s stash grows, it becomes more necessary to have a way to track its contents.
                                    </p>

                                    Ravelry, which debuted in 2007, is the website generally used by fiber artists to buy/sell patterns, track projects, track stash, as well as interact with others via forums.  In 2020, Ravelry underwent a redesign that caused it to become visually inaccessible for many and when concerns were expressed by the community, the website replied dismissively. This has led to a large part of the community wishing to divest from the website, but few options that are fully independent of Ravelry have gained traction. While there is demand for a complete replacement for Ravelry, my focus here is solely on tracking yarn and projects.

                                            <li>Conversations that took place on Instagram, through posts and stories made by popular fiber artists</li>
                                            <li>Posts on Reddit, primarily from those seeking stash organizing apps</li>
                                            <li>Reviews of the most popular Ravelry based apps Stash2Go and Ravit, as well as the inventory app Sortly</li>

                                            <li>Ravelry website on mobile or users of apps that connect with the Ravelry API (Stash2Go, Ravit, etc)</li>

                                            <li>General Inventory apps (Sortly, etc)</li>

<h2>Design Process:</h2>

                <h3>Objective:</h3>
                <p>Give fiber crafters a space to organize their yarn stash and track projects.</p> 
                <h3>Key Features:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Crafters can add yarn to their stash.</li>
                    <li>Crafters can add projects.</li>
                    <li>Crafters can earmark yarn (and quantities) for projects</li>
                    <li>Crafters can compare colors side by side for projects</li>
                    <li>Crafters can track the status and important details of works in progress (WIPs)</li>
                </ul>

                    <p>As a game developer and programmer, I decided to use an object-oriented approach to begin my design process. 
                    </p>

                </div>
            </div>

            <p>I started by listing out my four objects on green sticky notes: Crafter (the user), Yarn, Stash (collection of yarn), and Projects. Below each of these, I listed out attributes on orange sticky notes. Any attributes that would likely serve as a filter were placed on red sticky notes. Any objects that were nested under another shared the same green sticky notes as the object headers. Once all the notes were placed, I reordered them by importance. 
            </p>
            <p>I followed this process up with a user flow diagram.</p>
