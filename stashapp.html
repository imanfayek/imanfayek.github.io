                                    <p>Many fiber artists have what we refer to as a stash, or a collection of fiber for use in future projects. Each skein, or unit, of yarn has many important properties to keep track of that determine what projects it is most suitable for, what tools will work best, the drape of the finished object, etc. As oneâ€™s stash grows, it becomes more necessary to have a way to track its contents.
                                    </p>

                                    Ravelry, which debuted in 2007, is the website generally used by fiber artists to buy/sell patterns, track projects, track stash, as well as interact with others via forums.  In 2020, Ravelry underwent a redesign that caused it to become visually inaccessible for many and when concerns were expressed by the community, the website replied dismissively. This has led to a large part of the community wishing to divest from the website, but few options that are fully independent of Ravelry have gained traction. While there is demand for a complete replacement for Ravelry, my focus here is solely on tracking yarn and projects.

                                    <p>My app design is based on the following:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Conversations that took place on Instagram, through posts and stories made by fiber artists</li>
                                            <li>Posts on Reddit, primarily from those seeking stash organizing apps</li>
                                            <li>Reviews of the most popular Ravelry based apps Stash2Go and Ravit, as well as the inventory app Sortly</li>
                                            <li>An interview with a new knitter who does not use Ravelry and has no desire to, but has grown a sizeable stash and needs help organizing it</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>From my observations, there appears to be four primary methods of organization used:</p>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>Ravelry website on mobile or users of apps that connect with the Ravelry API (Stash2Go, Ravit, etc)</li>
                                            <li>Excel spreadsheet</li>
                                            <li>General Inventory apps (Sortly, etc)</li>
                                            <li>None (relying on memory)</li>
                                        </ol>
                                        <p>My focus is on those in Groups 2 and 3, potentially 4. </p>

                <h2>Design Process</h2>

                <h3>Objective:</h3>
                <p>Give fiber crafters a space to organize their yarn stash and track projects.</p> 
                <h3>Key Features:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Crafters can add yarn to their stash.</li>
                    <li>Crafters can add projects.</li>
                    <li>Crafters can earmark yarn (and quantities) for projects</li>
                    <li>Crafters can compare colors side by side for projects</li>
                    <li>Crafters can track the status and important details of works in progress (WIPs)</li>
                </ul>

            
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-6" id="header">
                    
                    <p>As a recreational programmer, I decided to use an object-oriented approach to begin my design process. 
                    </p>
                    
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6" >
                    
                    <img class="img-fluid" src="imgs/ux/StashOODCrop.png" alt="Generic placeholder ">
                </div>
            </div>


            <p>I did this by:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Listing out my objects on sticky notes and placing them in their own columns</li>
                <li>Under each column, listing out the attributes of the object (green)</li>
                <li>Color coded the attributes based on whether or not they would serve as filters (orange & red)</li>
                <li>Nesting related objects (green)</li>
                <li>Reordering sticky notes in each column based on importance</li>
            </ol>


            <p>I started broad and originally had a few more columns, but when categorizing importance, I realized that they went beyond my stated objective and key features. Should I move to expand this idea to include more features, I have a great place to start :)</p>

            <p>Next, I followed this process up with a user flow diagram.</p>
            <div class="row">
               
                <div class="col-md-12" >
                    
                    <img class="img-fluid" src="imgs/ux/StashTaskFlow.png" alt="Generic placeholder ">
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Using the sticky notes and the flow diagram, I was able to quickly set up a simple low-fidelity wireflow in Figma, followed by a higher fidelity version, which can be clicked through <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/NvzrDKZrbgJncOf4obXYNu/Stash-Flow?node-id=2397%3A3427&scaling=scale-down&page-id=2287%3A5610&starting-point-node-id=2397%3A3427" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

            
            <div class="row">
               
                <div class="col-md-6" >
                    
                   <img class="img-fluid" src="imgs/ux/StashWireframe2.png" alt="Generic placeholder">

            </div>

            <h2>Next Steps</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Test it out!</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>As someone who has prototyped a lot of UI in the Unity game engine (for a lot of things, it is probablyyyy overkill), I am excited to have learned a quick way to get simple ideas across!</li>
                <li>The object-oriented sticky note exercise really helped me focus on the necessary components and cull out of scope ideas. I do a similar exercise when designing how I will structure my code, but really enjoyed it in this form.</li>
            </ul>
